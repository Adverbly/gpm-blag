# New Numbers

## Part 1 
Let's imagine a world where we only ever knew about natural numbers(1,2,3...). We start doing some cool things with them like counting:
```
count(1) = 2
count(count(1)) = 3
count(count(count(1))) = 4
```
Lots of fun. But slow. *Too slow*. 

So one day we came up with this idea for a repeated counting function to save us from having to count a whole bunch. 

We call it **Addition**. 

We then start adding stuff and it's cool, but then one day we want to undo adding. 

We call it **Subtraction**. 

But then some smarty pants comes along and comes up with an expression that we don't have a number for! What is 1 - 2?

So we invent **negative numbers**.

## Part 2
One day, someone is doing a bunch of adding. 
```
2 + 2 = 4
2 + 2 + 2 = 6
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
```
Lots of fun. But slow. *Too slow*. 

So one day we came up with this idea for repeated addition function to save us from having to add a whole bunch. 

We call it **Multiplication**. 

We then start multiplying stuff and it's cool, but then one day we want to undo multiplying. 

We call it **Division**. 

But then some smarty pants comes along and comes up with an expression that we don't have a number for! What is 1 / 2?

So we invent **fractional numbers**.

## Part 3
One day, someone is doing a bunch of multiplying. 
```
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 2 * 2 = 8
2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16
```
Lots of fun. But slow. *Too slow*. 

So one day we came up with this idea for repeated multiplication function to save us from having to multiply a whole bunch.

We call it a **Power function**.

We then start powering stuff and it's cool, but then one day we want to undo powering. 

We call it a **Root function**.

But then some smarty pants comes along and comes up with an expression that we don't have a number for! What is the square root of -1?

So we invent **imaginary numbers**.

## Epilogue
My questions: 
1) Is there an explanation behind this pattern of repeated function -> inverted repeated function -> new number? 
2) If there is a real pattern here, does it continue?
